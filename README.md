#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ruchi Sharma, a graduate student at ðŸ“š The University of Texas at Austin pursuing MS in Business Analytics. Prior to this, I served as an Analytics Associate at the payments giant ðŸ’³ Mastercard Inc., working within the Data & Services arm. Stepping into the world of Data Science after earning a BTech in ðŸ§ª Chemical Engineering from the prestigious IIT Roorkee [Top 5 STEM School in India] was a result of exploring beyond traditional classroom learning. During my sophomore and junior year, I contributed to large-scale research focusing on the application of ðŸ’¬ NLP and Text Analytics to discover patterns for understanding conversational dynamics, track gender biases in academia and quantify the effect of investing in digital marketing capabilities. 

I am ðŸ‘” proficient in python, good with SQL and can work with R too. Additionally, I have good understanding of ðŸ¤“ Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning & Deep Learning Concepts, Natural Language Processing, and Time Series Analysis. Here are some of the cool projects I've done in the past:
1. [Network Analytics on Twitter Data](https://github.com/honeybadger21/Network-Analytics-Adani-Tweets/blob/main/AdaniNetworkAnalytics.ipynb)
2. [A/B Test in Python](https://github.com/honeybadger21/ABTest-Python/blob/main/ABTest.ipynb)
3. [Sales Prediction with Deep Learning](https://github.com/honeybadger21/sales-prediction-with-deep-learning/blob/main/FutureSalesDL.ipynb)
4. [Sentiment Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/honeybadger21/twitter-data-sentiment-analysis/blob/main/SentiTweets.ipynb)
5. [Price Prediction with Adv Regression Techniques](https://github.com/honeybadger21/house-prices-regression/blob/main/House-Prices.ipynb)
