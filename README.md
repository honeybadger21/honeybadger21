#### Hi there 👋

I am Ruchi Sharma, a graduate student at 📚 The University of Texas at Austin pursuing MS in Business Analytics. Prior to this, I served as an Analytics Consultant at the payments giant 💳 Mastercard Inc., working within the Data & Services arm. Stepping into the world of Data Science after earning a BTech in 🧪 Chemical Engineering from the prestigious IIT Roorkee was a result of exploring beyond traditional classroom learning. During my sophomore and junior year, I contributed to large-scale research focusing on the application of 💬 NLP and Text Analytics to discover patterns in conversational dynamics, track gender biases in academia and quantify the effect of investing in digital marketing capabilities. I also interned in the space of Finance research, estimating the cost of capital for the banking industry where I experimented with various models like CAPM and DCF. 

Presently, I am seeking full-time roles in Data Science, Machine Learning, and related fields starting May 2023. I am 👔 proficient in python, good with SQL and can work with R too. Additionally, I have good understanding of 🤓 Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Time Series Analysis. Learning never stops, and I will be studying 👩🏻‍🎓 Deep Learning, FinTech and Social Media Analytics in my final semester at UT Austin.
